#  UPI Transactions Data Analysis – Power BI Project
##  Project Description
This project focuses on analysing UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data using Power BI Desktop to understand transaction trends, customer behaviour, and balance movements. The report uses data profiling, interactive slicers, bookmarks, and conditional formatting to deliver an intuitive and dynamic analytics experience for end users.

##  Tools & Technologies
•	Power BI Desktop
•	DAX (for calculated columns & measures)
•	Interactive Visualizations
•	Bookmarks & Slicers

##  Project Implementation Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading & Preparation
•	Loaded UPI transaction data into Power BI Desktop
•	Performed data profiling to check data quality, completeness, and consistency
•	Created calculated columns such as Age Group for better segmentation

2️⃣ Data Modeling & Formatting
•	Adjusted size and positioning of visuals for clean report layout
•	Applied consistent formatting across visuals and slicers
•	Designed user-friendly slicers for filtering by:

o	Transaction Type
o	Date

3️⃣ Visual Analysis
•	Line Chart
o	Displays transaction trends over time
•	Matrix Visual
o	Shows detailed transaction breakdown by categories
•	Conditional Formatting
o	Highlights high-value and low-value transactions for quick insights

4️⃣ Interactive Features
•	Slicer Syncing
o	Ensures consistent filtering across report pages
•	Bookmarks for Transactions
o	Allows quick navigation between transaction views
•	Bookmarks for Remaining Balance
o	Enables users to toggle between transaction and balance analysis seamlessly

##  Key Insights Delivered
